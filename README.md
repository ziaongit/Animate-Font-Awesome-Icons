## Animate FontAwesome Icons
This is a simple project to create some animated font-awesome effects using vanilla JavaScript. This is a simple project but I thought a cool one to share. I am really liking creating things with plain JavaScript.

## JavaScript Functions used?
Yes this project used two vanilla JavaScript functions i.e
1. Window setTimeout() Method
2. Window setInterval() Method

### Review
With that two very simple functions we can create very cool animations for our projects. It can be used to display network signals, user online or offline and so on.
